		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-0


NEW FEATURES

    o Rd2roxygen uses the brand-new roxygen2 rather than the old
  roxygen package which is no longer maintained; users are recommended
  to read the NEWS file of roxygen2 carefully. Some major changes
  include: the description is in the second *paragraph* rather than
  the second *line* now (i.e. there is an empty line between the title
  and description); @format and @source are supported, and a series of
  new tags are introduced in roxygen2 too

MAJOR CHANGES

    o the escape and use.Rd2 arguments are removed in rab() since
  roxygen2 can handle these cases elegantly

    o roxygen.dir is the same as the package directory by default, so
  rab() will write all the documentations in the original package
  directory

    o the usage section is no longer reformatted by formatR; roxygen2
  formats it nicely

    o the function rm_undocumented() is no longer needed, so it was
  removed from this package; use @noRd if you do not want the
  documentation of a certain object to be generated by roxygen2
