		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.2

NEW FEATURES

  o added NULL to create_roxygen() when docType is data or package (#9)

  o Rd2roxygen() tries to add the @export tags according to the
  exported names in the NAMESPACE (#10, #11 and #12)

  o when reformatting usage and example sections, rab() tries to
  make code width smaller than 90, as required by R CMD check

MINOR CHANGES

  o the package vignette is built with knitr alone now (under R 3.0.x)

		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.1

NEW FEATURES

  o \item{} in the \value{} section will be formatted as the
  @returnItem tag, which is a new tag in roxygen2 (> 2.2.2) (#8)
  (thanks, Andreas Alfons)

  o R code in \dontrun{}, \dontshow{} and \donttest{} can be
  reformatted by formatR now

MINOR CHANGES

  o the vignette is built with knitr via the Makefile; in previous
  versions, it was a fake Rnw document (essentially a weaved tex file)

  o dependency on roxygen2 and formatR was changed to Imports

  o default value for 'check.opts' in rab() is '--as-cran' now


		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-7

NEW FEATURES

  o @section is supported now: \section{title}{content} will be
  converted to ##' @section title: content (thanks, Brian G. Peterson)

MINOR CHANGES

  o the package vignette now compiles with knitr instead of Sweave


		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-6

BUG FIXES

  o \dontrun{} can be correctly reformatted now; there was a bug in
  the previous version when options(replace.assign = TRUE)



		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-5

NEW FEATURES

  o usage for S3 methods like \method{generic}{class}(param = value)
  can be correctly reformatted now; in previous versions rab() will
  ignore such usage sections



		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-4

NEW FEATURES

  o Rd files that have \docType{data} or \docType{package} (for
  datasets and package documentation) are written into xxx-package.R
  directly; these names are not looked up in R scripts under the R
  directory of the source package

  o Rd comments (following %) will be ignored when generating roxygen
  comments for arguments



		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-3

NEW FEATURES

  o a complete example of running Rd2roxygen() on a real package was
  added to ?Rd2roxygen

  o re-run Rd2roxygen() on a package will remove the roxygen comments
  in R scripts before adding new roxygen comments parsed from Rd
  files; in old versions of this package, the old roxygen comments
  were not removed, hence the comments were added incrementally above
  the function objects, which was certainly not desirable

MINOR CHANGES

  o all these forms of quotes in assignments are allowed in
  Rd2roxygen(): `foo` <-, 'foo' <-, "foo" <-, and = can be used as the
  assigning operator as well



		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-2

MAJOR CHANGES

  o the usage sections in Rd files will be reformatted by default
  again when calling rab() (this feature was formerly removed in
  version 1.0-0)

MINOR CHANGES

  o rab(..., install = TRUE) will install the *.tar.gz file rather
  than the package directory; similarly, rab(..., check = TRUE) checks
  the tar ball as well



		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-1

MINOR CHANGES

  o the percent symbols in the examples code will be unescaped
  (i.e. \% becomes %) before the code is reformatted, then escaped
  again; this can avoid errors when reformatting the code, since \% is
  an illegal character in R



		  CHANGES IN Rd2roxygen VERSION 1.0-0


NEW FEATURES

    o Rd2roxygen uses the brand-new roxygen2 rather than the old
  roxygen package which is no longer maintained; users are recommended
  to read the NEWS file of roxygen2 carefully. Some major changes
  include: the description is in the second *paragraph* rather than
  the second *line* now (i.e. there is an empty line between the title
  and description); @format and @source are supported, and a series of
  new tags are introduced in roxygen2 too

MAJOR CHANGES

    o the escape and use.Rd2 arguments are removed in rab() since
  roxygen2 can handle these cases elegantly

    o roxygen.dir is the same as the package directory by default, so
  rab() will write all the documentations in the original package
  directory

    o the usage section is no longer reformatted by formatR; roxygen2
  formats it nicely

    o the function rm_undocumented() is no longer needed, so it was
  removed from this package; use @noRd if you do not want the
  documentation of a certain object to be generated by roxygen2
